## Project Introduction
BemIot Core is an out-of-the-box, lightweight digital infrastructure IoT platform that can be further developed. It provides a complete solution for IoT access, management, analysis, and application. The platform is developed based on the Java language and supports cross-platform independent deployment or distributed deployment, enabling the rapid establishment of a complete IoT business system that includes device management, rule linkage, alarm notification, video surveillance, edge computing, and other functions.

## Copyright Notice
BemIot Core adheres to the GPL-3.0 open-source license, making all its source code available for technical exchange and learning. According to this license, any code modified or derived from BemIot Core must not be distributed or sold as closed-source commercial software. If you intend to use BemIot Core locally for any commercial purpose, please obtain authorization by joining the [Cooperation Alliance](#) for free through the platform's official website, or contact the project leader for commercial authorization, to ensure your use complies with the GPL license.

## Core Features
- **Quick Deployment**: Developed based on Spring Boot 3.2.3, it provides out-of-the-box functionality for quickly setting up an IoT system.
- **Open Source**: All source codes are open and can be freely extended as needed. The software is designed with a separation of front-end and back-end, and all interfaces are fully open.
- **Flexible Access**: Supports multiple protocols such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, Websocket, MQTT, CoAP, OPC UA, Modbus, SNMP, ICE104, JT808, GB212, and more.
- **Plugin-Driven**: Adopting a hot-swappable plug-in model, it supports plug-in development, allows for rapid expansion of various protocol drivers, and supports cross-language development in languages such as C/C++, Python, Go, C#, PHP, Ruby, and Lua.
- **Rules Engine**: Utilizing a visual rule engine, rapid implementation of interconnected control over various business rules can be achieved through simple drag-and-drop operations.
- **Access Control**: Flexible non-intrusive data permission control. It can achieve data permission control at three dimensions: menu, button, and data. It can control the operation permission of single data.
- **Efficient Storage**: Integrating TDengine time-series database, it supports second-level processing of millions of data points, enhancing the efficiency of massive data storage and querying.
